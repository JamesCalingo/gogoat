## The Story

I've always had an interest in trains since I was a kid.

One day, when thinking of fun ideas to build, I came up with the idea of a bot based around informing users about their transportation info. 

Will the bot be right all of the time? No. This is the T we're talkin about.

However, I do hope that it can be useful so that you can attempt to keep your sanity while navigating the T.

### The Name

Some of you may recognize the name "GogoaT", as it's a Pokemon from Generation VI. I felt the name was perfect for this for multiple reasons:

- In PokÃ©mon X and Y, Gogoat is used as a method of public transportation
- The project is written in Go
- The MBTA (which this project was originally based on) is commonly known as the "T", hence why the last T in "GogoaT" is capitalized (with all due respect to Stockholm, Pittsburgh, and the Twin Cities)

### Why Boston?

I chose Boston because that's where I'm from.

...And also because it's one of the more technologically "savvy" transit operations in the United States, plus the system is relatively small (Lord help me if I had to do some of what I did with the NYC Subway's >400 stations and platforms).
